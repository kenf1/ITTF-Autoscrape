## Autoscrape ITTF Rankings

[![Scrape on schedule](https://github.com/kenf1/ITTF-Autoscrape/actions/workflows/actions.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kenf1/ITTF-Autoscrape/actions/workflows/actions.yml)

This project is a continuation of my previous ITTF_Rankings project where I scraped said data using both R and Python. In this project, I will be using Python to scrape and build a dashboard of the latest ITTF Men's Single Rankings.

__Note:__ To simplify the process and avoid running out of storage on this repo, the script will overwrite `data/dataset.csv` each time it is run.
